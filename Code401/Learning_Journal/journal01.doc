I have specific skills required for my job that take precedence for some topics. 
Every week I take a look at where I am struggling or a topic I need to understand better and 
focus my attention on this topic. 
I judge my understanding and skill of a topic based on my ability to recreate and implement
the code. I build small projects and environments to test new topics to ensure I have the right 
concepts and can implement new coding techniques.
