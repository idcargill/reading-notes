- availability of test resources

### Risk Magnitude indicators

- Medium: The effect may be tolerable but not desirable.
- Low: The effect is low and normal business is not impacted. 

### Risk Perspectives

- Effect: Determine the risks effect and impact.
- Cause: Assess risk by cause.  Find the risk triggers.
- Likelihood: Assess the risk probability.

## Test Coverage
