[intro to Big O Notation - Vaidehi Joshi](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs/8)

- O(1)             Constant time (Hash lookup)
- O(n)             Linear time   (single iteration)
- O(n<sup>2</sup>) Quadratic Time (nested loops)
- O(2^n)           Exponential (recursive functions)
- O(log n)         (Binary Search)

[Values in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AEJHKGk9ns)

- variables are separate from values
- variables point to values and are assigned independently
- memory without a reference are garbage collected
- assignment never copies data
- strings are always immutable
- list elements are references
- Don't mutate values when possible

```
# Rebinding
x = x + 1  # Rebinding of x

# Mutating
nums = []
nums.append(7) # Mutating 

```

- Names have no type / Values have no scope
