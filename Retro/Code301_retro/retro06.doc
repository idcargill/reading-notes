Retro 6

1. What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?
  Double check image api documentation. 

2. What did I learn today?
  Api images load with url not a data feed. 

3. What should I do differently next time?
  Keep api state as high as possible in the component tree. Easier to start high than move up later. 

4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
  Error handling with promieses/async.  
  Over writing large batches of CSS.

Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
Complete at this stage, more styling will be needed later. Raw functionality is working.
