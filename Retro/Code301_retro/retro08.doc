Retro 8

1. What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?
Code structure and overall flow. Stay stayed high and handled state, functions and classes were broken into separate modules. 

2. What did I learn today?
Run a spell checker in vsCode. Minor typos were difficult to detect.

3. What should I do differently next time?
Trust that if the http request is working properly then there is a request error. Also, double check the "error response." Wasn't expecting the movie "UNdefined."

4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
CSS grid / bootstrap   I waste a lot of time looking up raw layout. 


Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
Complete? The development works, backend API is deployed and working on Heroku.  I've been hit and miss with Netlify => Heroku connection.  Had a scripting error originally.
