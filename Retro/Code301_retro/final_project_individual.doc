The team did a good job of working on independent pieces to avoid merge conflicts. 
We were able to locally merge in any new branches and safely push up to the remote. From the beginning we had a wire frame concept in place to help us maintain organized structure. 
We would meet at the beginning of class to go over concepts and issues, and discuss how we would link our front-back data connections.
