1. What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?
Double check api output when there are major code changes.

2. What did I learn today?
Mashing in someone elses code is not alway easy.

3. What should I do differently next time?
Rewrite variable/output names first to align input/output api results. 

4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
Python virtual environments and managing path. (That's what's on my mind right now).


Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
Complete, but not styled very well.
