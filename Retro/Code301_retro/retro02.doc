1.	What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?
Original bootstrap has most of the styling documentation. 

2.	What did I learn today?
Array.map() returns and equal length array.  Which can lead to questionable results. 

3.	What should I do differently next time?
I’ll add in a little more styling.  I’m working towards concepts and glossing over styling. 

4.	What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
CSS.  A million ways to do everything. Locking down CSS Grid knowledge will be forever helpful. 


1.	Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
