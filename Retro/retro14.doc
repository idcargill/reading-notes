Retro 14

1. What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?
Iterating through the Auth0 setup components. 

2. What did I learn today?
OAth front end setup. 

3. What should I do differently next time?
Not pair code. 

4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
Oath Server access

Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
Incomplete.  Front end needs refactoring to manage conditional components.  Too many layers of conditional logic and large components.
