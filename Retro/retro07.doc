Retro 7 

What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?
Walking down the nested data path.  

What did I learn today?
When a function returens a promise then the promise is not being properly resolved.


What should I do differently next time?
Check an async functions return value type earlier. 

What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
I'm confused about the react key id for nested items. 

Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
completed
