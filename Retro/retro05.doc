Retro 5

1. What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?
  Environment creation and management. 

2. What did I learn today?
  I don’t know how to manage CSS themes in a larger project. 

3. What should I do differently next time?
  Have public projects available for samples.

4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
  CSS management of components VS style sheets.  It seems easier to manage a project with a full sheet, but component styling gets in the way. 

Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
  Complete, but unsatisfied with presentation.  Need to dive more into CSS templates.
