## Database Differences

| SQL                  | NoSQL                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Table Based          | Document Based                    |
| Relational DB        | Non-Relational DB                 |
| Predefined Structure | Dynamic Schema                    |
| SQL syntax           | Unstructured Query Language       |
| Scale with hardware  | Scale with servers to spread load |

1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?\
   Tabluar Data that would be easily viewed on a spreadsheet.

2. Give a real world example.\
   Business sales transactions, repetitive orders.

3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?\
   Unstructured and dynamic data that is not consistent for all records.

4. Give a real world example.\
   Recipes, there is a wide difference between many recipes listing all ingredients in the world is impractical.

5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?\
   SQL

6. Which type of database is best for scalability?\
   NoSQL

[Mongoose API](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#Model)
[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/BrowserRouter)

1. What does SQL stand for?\
   Structured Query Language

2. What is a relational database?
   MongoDB

3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?\
   Tabular data that can be scaled vertically.

4. What is a ‘schema’?\
   Schema is the organization structure of a database.

5. What is a NoSQL database?\
   A document based database that works with text data of key/value pairs.

6. How does it work?\
   There is a unique id for each record, and almost all of your information is in one record which eliminates the needs for relational joins.

7. What is inside of a Mongo database?\
   Documents of key:value pairs.

8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.\
   MongoDB, each row/record can be modified to store relevant information that might not pertain to any other record. There is no need to alter all data to make edit to a unique object.

9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?\
   The data is not structured across all records and does not work well for relational data and all records do no necessarily share the same fields.

## Things I want to know more about

- Mongoose, never used it
